# MQTT Configuration 
To enble/disable schedulers in the frontend and/or in an automation, you can use this feature. This allow to create dynamic switches entities in Home Assistant for each scheduler. 
The switch is in this form:
`switch.simplescheduler_id_scheduler_name`
Switch is created within a minute of the creation of a new scheduler, and removed as you delete a scheduler. 
To use the feature you need three things:
1.  a MQTT server (also named *broker*)
2. enable the MQTT integration in Home Assistant
3. activate the feature in Simplescheduler

It's less complicated than it seems!

## If you already have MQTT in Home Assistant
Set up Simplescheduler to point to your MQTT broker and set *Enabled* to *true*

    MQTT:
      enabled: true
      server: your_mqtt_server_address
      port: '1883'
      username: your_mqtt_user
      password: your_mqtt_password

If auth is not used, leave the *username* and *password* fields empty.
You also need the MQTT Integration in your Home Assistant with discovery enabled. If you use MQTT you should already have it but if you don't, take a look at step 2 in the next section.

## If you don't have MQTT configured
You have to follow three simple steps:

#### 1. Install the addon "Mosquitto broker"
Install the addon "Mosquitto broker", start it and enable "Start on boot". 
No configuration needed.

#### 2. Install the MQTT integration
In ***Configuration > Device & Services*** add the MQTT integration.
If you succesfully complete the prevous task, Home Assistant should automatically discover the integration and notify you to add it.

Click on CONFIGURE and leave all the default, but be sure to enable auto discovery

#### 3. Configure Simpleschedule
Simplescheduler is already pre-configured to use the Mosquitto Addon, so leave the *server* and the *port* parameter as default.
Set *enabled* to *true* and add the username and the password that you use to login in Home Assistant. 

    MQTT:
      enabled: true
      server: core-mosquitto
      port: '1883'
      username: your_homeassistant_user
      password: your_homeassistant_password

After that, restart the addon. 

If you don't want to write your main HA credentials in the add-on for any reason, you can create a new dedicated user and use those credentials.
